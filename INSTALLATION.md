<h1 name="intro">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;">The <em>Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management</em> (<em>DREAM</em>) tool is an open source software developed at PNNL for risk-based assessment and monitoring of geologic carbon sequestration and storage. The user can develop models in DREAM to find the optimal placement of monitoring technologies that will detect carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and brine leakage from storage formations.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;">The <em>Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management</em> (<em>DREAM</em>) tool was developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to guide the optimal placement of monitoring devices to detect carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) leakage from storage formations. The National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP) identified the need for a user-friendly tool with the ability to design site-specific, risk-based monitoring strategies. NRAP is<span style="color:black;">&nbsp;a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) project tasked with conducting risk and uncertainty analysis in the areas of reservoir performance, natural leakage pathways, wellbore integrity, groundwater protection, monitoring, and systems level modeling. Monitoring designs produced by DREAM may be&nbsp;</span>used by stakeholders and regulators to assist in compliance with regulatory requirements developed to ensure the safety of U.S. underground sources of drinking water (USDW) and ultimately lead to safe, permanent geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Further, site-specific designs generated by <span style="color:black;">DREAM allow for&nbsp;</span>potential generalizations to other sites, as well as comparisons between risk-based monitoring designs and monitoring designs for other purposes, if such designs should already exist (e.g., from a Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership [RCSP] site).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;">DREAM optimizes across user-provided subsurface leakage simulations based on user-specified leak parameters, factoring multiple objectives including minimizing cost, the earliest time to detection, or the volume of aquifer degraded. Currently, DREAM employs multi-objective optimization schemes that the user can select, including (i) Monte Carlo, (ii) Simulated Annealing, and (iii) Heuristic algorithm. The optimization schemes (i)-(iii) search for the optimal monitoring campaigns that minimize the tradeoff between the objectives, such as time to detection versus cost. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in;">Successful use of this software requires a rudimentary understanding of the leak scenarios, domain space, DREAM constraints, and the available optimization algorithms. There is rarely a definitively &ldquo;best&rdquo; monitoring solution, so DREAM instead functions as a support tool to highlight the opportunity trade-offs between good monitoring configurations. DREAM is limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the subsurface leakage simulations, so decision-makers will need to translate DREAM configurations to real-world monitoring configurations that factor in site-specific constraints at a finer level. Decision-makers should always ground truth DREAM results to operational principles.</p>
