<h1 style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.6pt;margin-left:0in;">ABSTRACT</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">This user manual provides a brief guide for use of the <em>Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management</em> (<em>DREAM</em>) tool Version 3.0, developed as part of the effort to quantify the risk of geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) under the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DOE) National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP). DREAM is an optimization tool created to identify optimal monitoring schemes that minimize the time to first detection of unintended CO<sub>2</sub> leakage from a subsurface storage formation. This user manual illustrates the program and graphical user interface (GUI), provides guidance on how to define the inputs required, and includes an example application for the user to follow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">DREAM optimizes across user-provided outputs from subsurface leakage simulations or uses outputs from reduced order models (ROM). While DREAM was developed for CO<sub>2</sub> leakage scenarios, it is applicable to any subsurface leakage simulation of the same output format.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">The DREAM tool is comprised of the four main components that are consecutively listed:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">(1) a Java wizard used to configure and execute the simulations,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">(2) a visualization tool to view the domain space and optimization results,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">(3) plotting outputs to visually analyze the results,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:9.6pt;text-indent:.25in;">(4) a Java application to aid users in converting common American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) output data to the standard DREAM hierarchical data format (HDF5).</p>
<p><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>DREAM optimizes across user-provided subsurface leakage simulations based on user-specified leak parameters, factoring multiple objectives including minimizing cost, the earliest time to detection, and the volume of aquifer degraded. Currently, DREAM employs multi-objective optimization schemes that the user can select, including (i) Monte Carlo, (ii) Simulated Annealing, and (iii) Heuristic algorithm. The optimization schemes (i)-(iii) search for the optimal monitoring campaigns that minimize the tradeoff between the objectives, such as time to detection versus cost. One such approach, simulated annealing, searches the solution space by iteratively mutating potential monitoring schemes built off various configurations of monitoring locations and leak detection parameters.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:11px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><a href="#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" language="JavaScript" name="_msoanchor_1">[KS1]</a>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>This approach has proven to be orders of magnitude faster than an exhaustive search of the entire solution space (Yonkofski et al., 2016).&nbsp;</span></p>
